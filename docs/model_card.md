# Model Card — ChannelViT (HetWet)

**Intended use:** Research/education for multiband imagery classification/regression using Vision Transformers with custom input channels.

**Training data:** Provide dataset provenance, licenses, and any pre-processing choices here.

**Metrics:** e.g., accuracy, F1, RMSE, R². Report stratified results where appropriate and include calibration.

**Limitations:** Synthetic example dataloader by default; replace with real raster loader. Model may be biased by data coverage and label quality.

**Hardware:** Developed to run on a single GPU; supports CPU for smoke tests.
